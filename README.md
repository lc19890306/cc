# Insight Data Engineering - Coding Challenge

This project is written in C++11, with the help of Boost library (1.58.0).

All source code files are put in src folder. Just "make" it to obtain the final executive which will be put in build folder (Install Boost 1.58.0 before that).

The run.sh script executes the executive to read input files from tweet_input folder and then yield expected outputs in tweet_output folder.
